These are elements we need to consider for product sense .

- Product Metrics - Defining KPIs for the given product. 
- Market size - gage how many users are going to use the product before launching.
- Metrics Trade Off - After launching - if one metric is gone up and other gone down, what kind of deicision we need to make for such trade off. 
- Product Modeling - invloves ML Algo for better user experience like recommendation system.
- Experiments - When we have various versions and variations in product, need to run an a/b experiment to know whihc product is better for users.
